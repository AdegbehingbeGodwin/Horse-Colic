# Horse-Colic
In this Project, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis using python on Horse Colic dataset and also, Built a machine learning model that predicts if an horse is likely to survive colic or not.

Check out this short article to understand colic in horses.

The dataset was obtained from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Horse+Colic.I carried out Data wrangling, cleaned the dataset and performed EDA on the data.I explored 2 different algorithms and implemented Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifier to build a classifier that predicts whether or not a horse is likely to survive colic or not.

Inspiration:

Horse colic is one of the biggest causes of death in horses. Veterinarians collects data during colic examination and this data guides them to make decision about the approach and the prognosis of an horse.

My goal is to Build a model that predicts if an horse is likely to survive or not.this will enable the veterinarian to make Fast diagnosis and prognosis which will increase the chances of survival. 
Colic can either be treated medically or surgically, so it assists a veterinarian to make better decisions in approach which saves time and effort.

Animals not likely to survive will be eased from pain (freedoms of animal welfare) by early prognosis through euthanasia.it will also save the horse owners from expenses for therapy. Fast diagnosis and prognosis which increases the chances of survival. Colic can either be treated medically or surgically, so it helps the veterinarian decides faster in changing approach saving time and effort.
